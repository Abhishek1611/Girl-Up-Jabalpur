<h1>ABOUT Girl Up Jabalpur</h1>
<p>Girl Up Jabalpur is a club founded under the Girl Up Campaign, 
<br>an initiative by the United Nations Foundation.
</p>

<p>
The Girl Up Campaign is all about helping girls and young women realise their true 
<br>potential and furthering the Gender Equality movement that has taken over the globe.
</p>

<p>
Hailing from Jabalpur and having seen the plight of both rural and urban women very closely, 
<br>we are deeply devoted to helping them. We became feminists at a very young age and want to 
<br>do our part in furthering the Feminist movement and clear the air around it. We want to help 
<br>create a world which is equal and is kind to one another.<br>
Kindness is our passion, it's something we strive for in the world.<br>

So this is us calling all the women and men out there, who support this cause, <br>
to join us and help us do the best we can!
<br>

Thank you. All the love.<br>

Treat people with kindness.ðŸ’«<br>
